# Hardware Setup

Description of the hardware and electrical circuits used in the demo.

There are [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) files that also have editable versions of the design:

 - [Sketch_1_-_no_HW_debounce.fzz](https://github.com/idcrook/rpi-iot-demo-2017/raw/master/info/Sketch_1_-_no_HW_debounce.fzz)
 - [Sketch_1_-_with_HW_debounce.fzz](https://github.com/idcrook/rpi-iot-demo-2017/raw/master/info/Sketch_1_-_with_HW_debounce.fzz)

A "debounce" circuit allows better reliability for determining switch presses.

## Parts list


LEDs and Switch

 - 2x 330 **Ω** Resistors (LED current limiters)
 - 2x 3mm PTH LEDs (one red, one green)
 - 1x 5mm momentary contact tactile switch (breadboard friendly)

 - Raspberry Pi, Power Supply, Ethernet cable, and mini-breadboard
 - Wires that can connect to header pins on Pi and breadboardg

Debounce circuit hardware

 - 1x 10 **kΩ** resistor
 - 1x 100 **nF** capacitor
